Buy any jeans necessary
Detroit wear cleaned up
From the streets of the league
From an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain

Haters sayin' ya changed
Now ya doin' ya thang
Good morning

While I hop in the Delorean
Scared-to-face-the-world complacent career student
Some people graduate, but we still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach us, teach us, Jesus
Okay, look up now, they done stole your streetness

Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' somethin' show ya how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mm hmm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?
You 'on't see just how wild the crowd is?
You 'on't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted, layaway or a deposit
My daddy'd say "When you see clothes, close your eyelids"
We was sorta like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'd get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and ayy
Did you realize (ayy, ayy)
That you were a champion in their eyes? (Ayy)
I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' somethin' show ya how we lived
Everything I wanted man it seemed so serious
Mm hmm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?
When it feel like livin's harder than dyin'
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to? Huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the drop out keepin' kids in the school
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems
Like I dropped out of P.E.
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible
Did you realize (ayy, ayy)
That you were a champion in their eyes? (Ayy)
This is the story of a champion
Runners on their mark and they pop the guns
Stand up, stand up, here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one
This is the story of a champion
Runners on their mark and they pop the guns

Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night (night, night)
(And I wonder) you say I think I'm never wrong (wrong, wrong)
(And I wonder) you know what, maybe you're right, aight?
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
word
(And I wonder) do you even remember what the issue is?
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what the intuition is (and I wonder)
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
and I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's what I'm (and I wonder)
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine? (And I wonder)
How many ladies in the house (if you know)
How many ladies in the house without a spouse (what it means)
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused (what it means)
What you about? (And I wonder)
On that independent shit (if you know)
Trade it all for a husband and some kids (what it means)
You ever wonder what it all really mean? (To find your dreams come true)
You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams

Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I gots to shine
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
I go-go for mine, I gots to shine

And watch the money pile up" the good life

Havin' money's the everything, not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on trizz
But when I get my card back activated
I'm back to Vegas (welcome to the good life)
'Cause I always had a passion for flashin' before I had it

When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V

So I parallel double park that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout back in my day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
But, homie, this is my day, class started two hours ago
Oh, am I late? (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive
Don't ever fix yo' lips like collagen
And then say something where you gonna end up apologin' (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Let that man get cash
Let that man get passed
He 'on't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the Pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's yo' pleasure?
Life is a, uh, dependin' how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam, Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort

Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's department
You more like "love to start shit"
I'm more of the, trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know?
Flashing lights (lights, light)

Flashing lights (lights, lights)
I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doing my thing

And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum

Damn
Here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn
Here we go again
People talking shit but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
I'll never be picture perfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet
He was black as the street was
I never be laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah
I never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summer time like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn
Here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn
Here we go again
People talking shit but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me in barber shops
They forget to get they haircut
Okay, fair enough the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun talk or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reebok's or Adidas
Can I add that he do spazz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP awards
Goodbye to the India Arie awards
They rather give me the n-nigga please award
But I'll just take the I got a lot of cheese award
Damn
Here we go again
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn
Here we go again
People talking shit but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
I know people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
Man killing's some wack shit
Oh I forgot except for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'
He got changed over his chain a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody pastor
The church want tie so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door 'cause I can't afford to stay
My 15 seconds up but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today
Damn
Here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn
Here we go again
People talking shit but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

Now where the south side, now where the west side
Can I talk my shit again?
Even if I don't hit again?
Dog are you fucking kidding?
My hat, my shoes, my coat
Louis Vuitton stitch, with Donatella Versace
That's Louis Vuitton's bitch
I think Hennessy, I drank, I'm gone
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona, I'm zoning
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
Two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
And, hey please don't start me
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pop the Barkers, I'm hood the Parkers
While y'all was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game, roc-a-chain instead of a wedding ring
Y'all bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when 'Ye romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
I'm on a world tour with Common, my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van it's easy
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy
And, oh yeah, Yeezy
I did it for the glory
Now where the south side, now where the west side
What am I supposed to do now?
Man the game all messed up
How I'm suppose to stand out when everyone get dressed up?
So yeah, at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego
I can stand there in a speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night
The grind, the empty bottles of no-doze
Tank on empty, whipping my mamma's Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes, shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss
Why I gotta ask what that two-door cost
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking about her girlfriends
Yeah, the dark skinny ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em
When you meet me in person what do you feel like?
I know, I know I look better in real life
O' hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Anyone, Big Pun, Big L or Notorious, fit in
Get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'm gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
Now where the south side, now where the west side
Yeah I'ma stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
These haters be killing themselves they wanna come and get the glory

I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said "'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!"
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do, just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
Maybe you, do you remember when?
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe you, do you remember when?
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again

Stadium status
Uh
My big brother was Big's brother
Used to be Dame and Big's brother
Who was hip hop brother
Who was No I.D friend
No I.D my mentor
Now let the story begin
Its the hard knock life tour
Sell out, picture us in the mall
Copin iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yea that's what we would yell out, yell out
You know the name, do gotta spell out or tell bout
J a y an Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind he could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you could brag to your friends back at the gig
But he got me out my mama crib
Then he help me get my mama a crib
Big brother was Big's Brother
Used to be Dame and Big's Brother
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D friend
No I.D my mentor, now let the story begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands
Fresh off the plane I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm about to take mine
Around the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little song in that old back room
He would bob his head and say, damn, oh, that's you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Party at S.O.B's and we had packed the crowd
Big brother got his show up in Madison Square
And I'm like yea, yea we gonna be there
But not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinking a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm at the top and everybody on the scrotum
My big Brother was Big's brother
Used to be Dame and Big's brother
Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.D's friend
No I.D my mentor, now let the story begin
Begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client, the presidito, Hola Hovito
The game getting foul, so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peep hole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now I'm on a steep hole
And we know
New jack city gotta keep my brother
But to be number 1, I'm a beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I'd spaz
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was driving me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kick a flow it was like, pick and roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, its give and go
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
but I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo
Y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Cold Play
Next thing I know he got a song with Cold Play
Back in my mind I'm like damn, no way
Translate español
No way Jose
Then I went and told J Brown
Should of known that was gonna come back around
Should of told you like a man, should of told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
My big brother was Big's brother
So here's a few words from your kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go ahead and tell um
People never get the flowers while they could still smell um
A idol in my eyes, God of the game
Heart of the city, Rockafella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number 1 young Hov also my big brother
My big Brother was Bigs brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother
Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.D's friend
No I.D my mentor, and that's where the story ends
Don't kill this shit

I'm not sure anymore-more
Who is knocking at my door-door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true
I don't wanna say goodbye to you
So I'll just say good night to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gonna say good night
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you don't really know cause you can't recall them
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life, if you try to
So close, but so far
And so far, no cigar
We can't dwell on the past all we got is today
So I'm a live like there's no tomorrow
No goodbye
I don't wanna say goodbye to you
So I'll just say good night to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gonna say good night
Uh, to you
If I part my heart will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like everyday new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical
My art will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like everyday new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical
I don't wanna say goodbye to you
So I'll just say good night to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gonna say good night
I'm not sure anymore-more
Who is knocking at my door-door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true
I'm not sure anymore-more
Who is knocking at my door-door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true
I'm not sure anymore-more
Who is knocking at my door-door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true
